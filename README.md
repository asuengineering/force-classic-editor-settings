# ASU Engineering - Force Classic Editor Coexistence

Contributors: Steve Ryan (ASU Engineering)
Requires at least: 4.9.8
Tested up to: 4.9.8
Stable tag: 0.1

## Description

Plugin to force the settings of the [Classic Editor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/) plugin to prevent the user from completely hiding the Gutenberg editor. The Classic Editor plugin will therefore always operate in "allow both editors" mode. Perfect coexistence &amp; harmony unlocked.

## Changelog

### 0.1

* Initial creation. Code inspired by the inner workings of the [Classic Editor Addon](https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor-addon/) plugin, which does the opposite of what this does.

## To Do

* Disable the plugin option from General->Writing to prevent user confusion.
* Disable the settings link within `plugins.php` for the Classic Editor plugin.
